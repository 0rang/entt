Introduction</h1>
<p><code>EnTT</code> is a header-only, tiny and easy to use entity-component system (and much more) written in modern C++.<br />
 The entity-component-system (also known as <em>ECS</em>) is an architectural pattern used mostly in game development.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md10"></a>
Design choices</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md11"></a>
A bitset-free entity-component system</h2>
<p><code>EnTT</code> is a <em>bitset-free</em> entity-component system that doesn't require users to specify the component set at compile-time.<br />
 This is why users can instantiate the core class simply like:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html">entt::DefaultRegistry</a> registry;</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>In place of its more annoying and error-prone counterpart:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html">entt::DefaultRegistry</a>&lt;Comp0, Comp1, ..., CompN&gt; registry;</div></div><!-- fragment --><h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md12"></a>
Pay per use</h2>
<p><code>EnTT</code> is entirely designed around the principle that users have to pay only for what they want.</p>
<p>When it comes to using an entity-component system, the tradeoff is usually between performance and memory usage. The faster it is, the more memory it uses. However, slightly worse performance along non-critical paths are the right price to pay to reduce memory usage and I've always wondered why this kind of tools do not leave me the choice.<br />
 <code>EnTT</code> follows a completely different approach. It squeezes the best from the basic data structures and gives users the possibility to pay more for higher performance where needed.<br />
 The disadvantage of this approach is that users need to know the systems they are working on and the tools they are using. Otherwise, the risk to ruin the performance along critical paths is high.</p>
<p>So far, this choice has proven to be a good one and I really hope it can be for many others besides me.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md13"></a>
Vademecum</h1>
<p>The <code>Registry</code> to store, the views to iterate. That's all.</p>
<p>An entity (the <em>E</em> of an <em>ECS</em>) is an opaque identifier that users should just use as-is and store around if needed. Do not try to inspect an entity identifier, its format can change in future and a registry offers all the functionalities to query them out-of-the-box. The underlying type of an entity (either <code>std::uint16_t</code>, <code>std::uint32_t</code> or <code>std::uint64_t</code>) can be specified when defining a registry (actually the <code>DefaultRegistry</code> is nothing more than a <code>Registry</code> where the type of the entities is <code>std::uint32_t</code>).<br />
 Components (the <em>C</em> of an <em>ECS</em>) should be plain old data structures or more complex and movable data structures with a proper constructor. Actually, the sole requirement of a component type is that it must be both move constructible and move assignable. They are list initialized by using the parameters provided to construct the component itself. No need to register components or their types neither with the registry nor with the entity-component system at all.<br />
 Systems (the <em>S</em> of an <em>ECS</em>) are just plain functions, functors, lambdas or whatever users want. They can accept a <code>Registry</code> or a view of any type and use them the way they prefer. No need to register systems or their types neither with the registry nor with the entity-component system at all.</p>
<p>The following sections will explain in short how to use the entity-component system, the core part of the whole library.<br />
 In fact, the project is composed of many other classes in addition to those describe below. For more details, please refer to the inline documentation.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md14"></a>
The Registry, the Entity and the Component</h1>
<p>A registry can store and manage entities, as well as create views to iterate the underlying data structures.<br />
 <code>Registry</code> is a class template that lets users decide what's the preferred type to represent an entity. Because <code>std::uint32_t</code> is large enough for almost all the cases, there exists also an alias named <code>DefaultRegistry</code> for <code>Registry&lt;std::uint32_t&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Entities are represented by <em>entity identifiers</em>. An entity identifier is an opaque type that users should not inspect or modify in any way. It carries information about the entity itself and its version.</p>
<p>A registry can be used both to construct and destroy entities:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="comment">// constructs a naked entity with no components and returns its identifier</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> entity = registry.create();</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// destroys an entity and all its components</span></div><div class="line">registry.destroy(entity);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Entities can also be destroyed <em>by type</em>, that is by specifying the types of the tags or components that identify them:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="comment">// destroys the entity that owns the given tag, if any</span></div><div class="line">registry.destroy&lt;MyTag&gt;(<a class="code" href="structentt_1_1tag__t.html">entt::tag_t</a>{});</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// destroys the entities that own the given components, if any</span></div><div class="line">registry.destroy&lt;AComponent, AnotherComponent&gt;();</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>When an entity is destroyed, the registry can freely reuse it internally with a slightly different identifier. In particular, the version of an entity is increased each and every time it's discarded.<br />
 In case entity identifiers are stored around, the registry offers all the functionalities required to test them and get out of the them all the information they carry:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="comment">// returns true if the entity is still valid, false otherwise</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">bool</span> b = registry.valid(entity);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// gets the version contained in the entity identifier</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> version = registry.version(entity);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// gets the actual version for the given entity</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> curr = registry.current(entity);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Components can be assigned to or removed from entities at any time with a few calls to member functions of the registry. As for the entities, the registry offers also a set of functionalities users can use to work with the components.</p>
<p>The <code>assign</code> member function template creates, initializes and assigns to an entity the given component. It accepts a variable number of arguments to construct the component itself if present:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">registry.assign&lt;Position&gt;(entity, 0., 0.);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// ...</span></div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">Velocity &amp;velocity = registry.assign&lt;Velocity&gt;(entity);</div><div class="line">velocity.dx = 0.;</div><div class="line">velocity.dy = 0.;</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>If an entity already has the given component, the <code>replace</code> member function template can be used to replace it:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">registry.replace&lt;Position&gt;(entity, 0., 0.);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// ...</span></div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">Velocity &amp;velocity = registry.replace&lt;Velocity&gt;(entity);</div><div class="line">velocity.dx = 0.;</div><div class="line">velocity.dy = 0.;</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>In case users want to assign a component to an entity, but it's unknown whether the entity already has it or not, <code>accommodate</code> does the work in a single call (there is a performance penalty to pay for this mainly due to the fact that it has to check if the entity already has the given component or not):</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">registry.accommodate&lt;Position&gt;(entity, 0., 0.);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// ...</span></div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">Velocity &amp;velocity = registry.accommodate&lt;Velocity&gt;(entity);</div><div class="line">velocity.dx = 0.;</div><div class="line">velocity.dy = 0.;</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Note that <code>accommodate</code> is a slightly faster alternative for the following <code>if/else</code> statement and nothing more:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keywordflow">if</span>(registry.has&lt;Comp&gt;(entity)) {</div><div class="line">    registry.replace&lt;Comp&gt;(entity, arg1, argN);</div><div class="line">} <span class="keywordflow">else</span> {</div><div class="line">    registry.assign&lt;Comp&gt;(entity, arg1, argN);</div><div class="line">}</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>As already shown, if in doubt about whether or not an entity has one or more components, the <code>has</code> member function template may be useful:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">bool</span> b = registry.has&lt;Position, Velocity&gt;(entity);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>On the other side, if the goal is to delete a single component, the <code>remove</code> member function template is the way to go when it's certain that the entity owns a copy of the component:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">registry.remove&lt;Position&gt;(entity);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Otherwise consider to use the <code>reset</code> member function. It behaves similarly to <code>remove</code> but with a strictly defined behavior (and a performance penalty is the price to pay for this). In particular it removes the component if and only if it exists, otherwise it returns safely to the caller:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">registry.reset&lt;Position&gt;(entity);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>There exist also two other <em>versions</em> of the <code>reset</code> member function:</p>
<ul>
<li>If no entity is passed to it, <code>reset</code> will remove the given component from each entity that has it:</li>
</ul>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">registry.reset&lt;Position&gt;();</div></div><!-- fragment --><ul>
<li>If neither the entity nor the component are specified, all the entities still in use and their components are destroyed:</li>
</ul>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">registry.reset();</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Finally, references to components can be retrieved simply by doing this:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keyword">auto</span> &amp;cregistry = registry;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// const and non-const reference</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> Position &amp;position = cregistry.get&lt;Position&gt;(entity);</div><div class="line">Position &amp;position = registry.get&lt;Position&gt;(entity);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// const and non-const references</span></div><div class="line">std::tuple&lt;const Position &amp;, const Velocity &amp;&gt; tup = cregistry.get&lt;Position, Velocity&gt;(entity);</div><div class="line">std::tuple&lt;Position &amp;, Velocity &amp;&gt; tup = registry.get&lt;Position, Velocity&gt;(entity);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>The <code>get</code> member function template gives direct access to the component of an entity stored in the underlying data structures of the registry.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md15"></a>
Single instance components</h2>
<p>In those cases where all what is needed is a single instance component, tags are the right tool to achieve the purpose.<br />
 Tags undergo the same requirements of components. They can be either plain old data structures or more complex and movable data structures with a proper constructor.<br />
 Actually, the same type can be used both as a tag and as a component and the registry will not complain about it. It is up to users to properly manage their own types. In some cases, the tag <code>tag_t</code> must also be used in order to disambiguate overloads of member functions.</p>
<p>Attaching tags to entities and removing them is trivial:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> player = registry.create();</div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> camera = registry.create();</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// attaches a default-initialized tag to an entity</span></div><div class="line">registry.assign&lt;PlayingCharacter&gt;(<a class="code" href="structentt_1_1tag__t.html">entt::tag_t</a>{}, player);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// attaches a tag to an entity and initializes it</span></div><div class="line">registry.assign&lt;Camera&gt;(<a class="code" href="structentt_1_1tag__t.html">entt::tag_t</a>{}, camera, player);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// removes tags from their owners</span></div><div class="line">registry.remove&lt;PlayingCharacter&gt;();</div><div class="line">registry.remove&lt;Camera&gt;();</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>In case a tag already has an owner, its content can be updated by means of the <code>replace</code> member function template and the ownership of the tag can be transferred to another entity using the <code>move</code> member function template:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">// replaces the content of the given tag</div><div class="line">Point &amp;point = registry.replace&lt;Point&gt;(entt::tag_t{}, 1.f, 1.f);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">// transfers the ownership of the tag to another entity</div><div class="line">entity_type prev = registry.move&lt;Point&gt;(next);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>If in doubt about whether or not a tag already has an owner, the <code>has</code> member function template may be useful:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">bool</span> b = registry.has&lt;PlayingCharacter&gt;();</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>References to tags can be retrieved simply by doing this:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keyword">auto</span> &amp;cregistry = registry;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// either a non-const reference ...</span></div><div class="line">PlayingCharacter &amp;player = registry.get&lt;PlayingCharacter&gt;();</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// ... or a const one</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> Camera &amp;camera = cregistry.get&lt;Camera&gt;();</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>The <code>get</code> member function template gives direct access to the tag as stored in the underlying data structures of the registry.</p>
<p>As shown above, in almost all the cases the entity identifier isn't required. Since a single instance component can have only one associated entity, it doesn't make much sense to mention it explicitly.<br />
 To find out who the owner is, just do the following:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> player = registry.attachee&lt;PlayingCharacter&gt;();</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Note that iterating tags isn't possible for obvious reasons. Tags give direct access to single entities and nothing more.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md16"></a>
Observe changes</h2>
<p>Because of how the registry works internally, it stores a couple of signal handlers for each pool in order to notify some of its data structures on the construction and destruction of components.<br />
 These signal handlers are also exposed and made available to users. This is the basic brick to build fancy things like dependencies and reactive systems.</p>
<p>To get a sink to be used to connect and disconnect listeners so as to be notified on the creation of a component, use the <code>construction</code> member function:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="comment">// connects a free function</span></div><div class="line">registry.construction&lt;Position&gt;().connect&lt;&amp;MyFreeFunction&gt;();</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// connects a member function</span></div><div class="line">registry.construction&lt;Position&gt;().connect&lt;MyClass, &amp;MyClass::member&gt;(&amp;instance);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// disconnects a free function</span></div><div class="line">registry.construction&lt;Position&gt;().disconnect&lt;&amp;MyFreeFunction&gt;();</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// disconnects a member function</span></div><div class="line">registry.construction&lt;Position&gt;().disconnect&lt;MyClass, &amp;MyClass::member&gt;(&amp;instance);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>To be notified when components are destroyed, use the <code>destruction</code> member function instead.</p>
<p>The function type of a listener is the same in both cases:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">void(Registry&lt;Entity&gt; &amp;, Entity);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>In other terms, a listener is provided with the registry that triggered the notification and the entity affected by the change. Note also that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listeners are invoked <b>after</b> components have been assigned to entities.</li>
<li>Listeners are invoked <b>before</b> components have been removed from entities.</li>
<li>The order of invocation of the listeners isn't guaranteed in any case.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some limitations on what a listener can and cannot do. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connecting and disconnecting other functions from within the body of a listener should be avoided. It can lead to undefined behavior in some cases.</li>
<li>Assigning and removing components and tags from within the body of a listener that observes the destruction of instances of a given type should be avoided. It can lead to undefined behavior in some cases. This type of listeners is intended to provide users with an easy way to perform cleanup and nothing more.</li>
</ul>
<p>To a certain extent, these limitations do not apply. However, it is risky to try to force them and users should respect the limitations unless they know exactly what they are doing. Subtle bugs are the price to pay in case of errors otherwise.</p>
<p>In general, events and therefore listeners must not be used as replacements for systems. They should not contain much logic and interactions with a registry should be kept to a minimum, if possible. Note also that the greater the number of listeners, the greater the performance hit when components are created or destroyed.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md17"></a>
Who let the tags out?</h3>
<p>As an extension, signals are also provided with tags. Although they are not strictly required internally, it makes sense that a user expects signal support even when it comes to tags actually.<br />
 Signals for tags undergo exactly the same requirements of those introduced for components. Also the function type for a listener is the same and it's invoked with the same guarantees discussed above.</p>
<p>To get the sinks for a tag just use tag <code>tag_t</code> to disambiguate overloads of member functions as in the following example:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">registry.construction&lt;MyTag&gt;(<a class="code" href="structentt_1_1tag__t.html">entt::tag_t</a>{}).connect&lt;&amp;MyFreeFunction&gt;();</div><div class="line">registry.destruction&lt;MyTag&gt;(<a class="code" href="structentt_1_1tag__t.html">entt::tag_t</a>{}).connect&lt;MyClass, &amp;MyClass::member&gt;(&amp;instance);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Listeners for tags and components are managed separately and do not influence each other in any case. Therefore, note that the greater the number of listeners for a type, the greater the performance hit when a tag of the given type is created or destroyed.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md18"></a>
Runtime components</h2>
<p>Defining components at runtime is useful to support plugin systems and mods in general. However, it seems impossible with a tool designed around a bunch of templates. Indeed it's not that difficult.<br />
 Of course, some features cannot be easily exported into a runtime environment. As an example, sorting a group of components defined at runtime isn't for free if compared to most of the other operations. However, the basic functionalities of an entity-component system such as <code>EnTT</code> fit the problem perfectly and can also be used to manage runtime components if required.<br />
 All that is necessary to do it is to know the identifiers of the components. An identifier is nothing more than a number or similar that can be used at runtime to work with the type system.</p>
<p>In <code>EnTT</code>, identifiers are easily accessible:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html">entt::DefaultRegistry</a> registry;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// standard component identifier</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> ctype = registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#a682552d500d7768b5d9d4e5f547cdfaf">type</a>&lt;Position&gt;();</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// single instance component identifier</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> ttype = registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#a682552d500d7768b5d9d4e5f547cdfaf">type</a>&lt;PlayingCharacter&gt;(<a class="code" href="structentt_1_1tag__t.html">entt::tag_t</a>{});</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Once the identifiers are made available, almost everything becomes pretty simple.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md19"></a>
A journey through a plugin</h3>
<p><code>EnTT</code> comes with an example (actually a test) that shows how to integrate compile-time and runtime components in a stack based JavaScript environment. It uses <a href="https://github.com/svaarala/duktape"><code>Duktape</code></a> under the hood, mainly because I wanted to learn how it works at the time I was writing the code.</p>
<p>The code is not production-ready and overall performance can be highly improved. However, I sacrificed optimizations in favor of a more readable piece of code. I hope I succeeded.<br />
 Note also that this isn't neither the only nor (probably) the best way to do it. In fact, the right way depends on the scripting language and the problem one is facing in general.<br />
 That being said, feel free to use it at your own risk.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that of creating a compile-time component aimed to map all the runtime components assigned to an entity.<br />
 Identifiers come in use to address the right function from a map when invoked from the runtime environment and to filter entities when iterating.<br />
 With a bit of gymnastic, one can narrow views and improve the performance to some extent but it was not the goal of the example.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md20"></a>
Sorting: is it possible?</h2>
<p>It goes without saying that sorting entities and components is possible with <code>EnTT</code>.<br />
 In fact, there are two functions that respond to slightly different needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Components can be sorted directly:</li>
</ul>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#acb72e05f3128b6604b438707eabdfa4a">sort</a>&lt;Renderable&gt;([](<span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keyword">auto</span> &amp;lhs, <span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keyword">auto</span> &amp;rhs) {</div><div class="line">    <span class="keywordflow">return</span> lhs.z &lt; rhs.z;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">});</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>There exists also the possibility to use a custom sort function object, as long as it adheres to the requirements described in the inline documentation.<br />
 This is possible mainly because users can get much more with a custom sort function object if the pattern of usage is known. As an example, in case of an almost sorted pool, quick sort could be much, much slower than insertion sort.</p>
<ul>
<li>Components can be sorted according to the order imposed by another component:</li>
</ul>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#acb72e05f3128b6604b438707eabdfa4a">sort</a>&lt;Movement, Physics&gt;();</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>In this case, instances of <code>Movement</code> are arranged in memory so that cache misses are minimized when the two components are iterated together.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md21"></a>
Snapshot: complete vs continuous</h2>
<p>The <code>Registry</code> class offers basic support to serialization.<br />
 It doesn't convert components and tags to bytes directly, there wasn't the need of another tool for serialization out there. Instead, it accepts an opaque object with a suitable interface (namely an <em>archive</em>) to serialize its internal data structures and restore them later. The way types and instances are converted to a bunch of bytes is completely in charge to the archive and thus to final users.</p>
<p>The goal of the serialization part is to allow users to make both a dump of the entire registry or a narrower snapshot, that is to select only the components and the tags in which they are interested.<br />
 Intuitively, the use cases are different. As an example, the first approach is suitable for local save/restore functionalities while the latter is suitable for creating client-server applications and for transferring somehow parts of the representation side to side.</p>
<p>To take a snapshot of the registry, use the <code>snapshot</code> member function. It returns a temporary object properly initialized to <em>save</em> the whole registry or parts of it.</p>
<p>Example of use:</p>

What functions to use in which case mostly depends on the goal and there is not a golden rule to do that.</p>
<p>The <code>entities</code> member function asks the registry to serialize all the entities that are still in use along with their versions. On the other side, the <code>destroyed</code> member function tells to the registry to serialize the entities that have been destroyed and are no longer in use.<br />
 These two functions can be used to save and restore the whole set of entities with the versions they had during serialization.</p>
<p>The <code>component</code> member function is a function template the aim of which is to store aside components. The presence of a template parameter list is a consequence of a couple of design choices from the past and in the present:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, there is no reason to force a user to serialize all the components at once and most of the times it isn't desiderable. As an example, in case the stuff for the HUD in a game is put into the registry for some reasons, its components can be freely discarded during a serialization step because probably the software already knows how to reconstruct the HUD correctly from scratch.</li>
<li>Furthermore, the registry makes heavy use of <em>type-erasure</em> techniques internally and doesn't know at any time what types of components it contains. Therefore being explicit at the call point is mandatory.</li>
</ul>
<p>There exists also another version of the <code>component</code> member function that accepts a range of entities to serialize. This version is a bit slower than the other one, mainly because it iterates the range of entities more than once for internal purposes. However, it can be used to filter out those entities that shouldn't be serialized for some reasons.<br />
 As an example:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keyword">auto</span> view = registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#aed83d4c8f80ae647ee73f2a8440fa09d">view</a>&lt;Serialize&gt;();</div><div class="line">OutputArchive output;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#a00a0b4949a4cc0cb87e88cc6d1171a9d">snapshot</a>()</div><div class="line">    .component&lt;AComponent, AnotherComponent&gt;(output, view.cbegin(), view.cend());</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>The <code>tag</code> member function is similar to the previous one, apart from the fact that it works with tags and not with components.<br />
 Note also that both <code>component</code> and <code>tag</code> store items along with entities. It means that they work properly without a call to the <code>entities</code> member function.</p>
<p>Once a snapshot is created, there exist mainly two <em>ways</em> to load it: as a whole and in a kind of <em>continuous mode</em>.<br />
 The following sections describe both loaders and archives in details.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md22"></a>
Snapshot loader</h3>
<p>A snapshot loader requires that the destination registry be empty and loads all the data at once while keeping intact the identifiers that the entities originally had.<br />
 To do that, the registry offers a member function named <code>restore</code> that returns a temporary object properly initialized to <em>restore</em> a snapshot.</p>
<p>Example of use:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">InputArchive input;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#a37b755b43c7067658d2b4129baa403cf">restore</a>()</div><div class="line">    .entities(input)</div><div class="line">    .destroyed(input)</div><div class="line">    .component&lt;AComponent, AnotherComponent&gt;(input)</div><div class="line">    .tag&lt;MyTag&gt;(input)</div><div class="line">    .orphans();</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>It isn't necessary to invoke all these functions each and every time. What functions to use in which case mostly depends on the goal and there is not a golden rule to do that. For obvious reasons, what is important is that the data are restored in exactly the same order in which they were serialized.</p>
<p>The <code>entities</code> and <code>destroyed</code> member functions restore the sets of entities and the versions that the entities originally had at the source.</p>
<p>The <code>component</code> member function restores all and only the components specified and assigns them to the right entities. Note that the template parameter list must be exactly the same used during the serialization. The same applies to the <code>tag</code> member function.</p>
<p>The <code>orphans</code> member function literally destroys those entities that have neither components nor tags. It's usually useless if the snapshot is a full dump of the source. However, in case all the entities are serialized but only few components and tags are saved, it could happen that some of the entities have neither components nor tags once restored. The best users can do to deal with them is to destroy those entities and thus update their versions.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md23"></a>
Continuous loader</h3>
<p>A continuous loader is designed to load data from a source registry to a (possibly) non-empty destination. The loader can accommodate in a registry more than one snapshot in a sort of <em>continuous loading</em> that updates the destination one step at a time.<br />
 Identifiers that entities originally had are not transferred to the target. Instead, the loader maps remote identifiers to local ones while restoring a snapshot. Because of that, this kind of loader offers a way to update automatically identifiers that are part of components or tags (as an example, as data members or gathered in a container).<br />
 Another difference with the snapshot loader is that the continuous loader does not need to work with the private data structures of a registry. Furthermore, it has an internal state that must persist over time. Therefore, there is no reason to create it by means of a registry, or to limit its lifetime to that of a temporary object.</p>
<p>Example of use:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a class="code" href="classentt_1_1ContinuousLoader.html">entt::ContinuousLoader&lt;entity_type&gt;</a> loader{registry};</div><div class="line">InputArchive input;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">loader.entities(input)</div><div class="line">    .destroyed(input)</div><div class="line">    .component&lt;AComponent, AnotherComponent, DirtyComponent&gt;(input, &amp;DirtyComponent::parent, &amp;DirtyComponent::child)</div><div class="line">    .tag&lt;MyTag, DirtyTag&gt;(input, &amp;DirtyTag::container)</div><div class="line">    .orphans()</div><div class="line">    .shrink();</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>It isn't necessary to invoke all these functions each and every time. What functions to use in which case mostly depends on the goal and there is not a golden rule to do that. For obvious reasons, what is important is that the data are restored in exactly the same order in which they were serialized.</p>
<p>The <code>entities</code> and <code>destroyed</code> member functions restore groups of entities and map each entity to a local counterpart when required. In other terms, for each remote entity identifier not yet registered by the loader, the latter creates a local identifier so that it can keep the local entity in sync with the remote one.</p>
<p>The <code>component</code> and <code>tag</code> member functions restore all and only the components and the tags specified and assign them to the right entities.<br />
 In case the component or the tag contains entities itself (either as data members of type <code>entity_type</code> or as containers of entities), the loader can update them automatically. To do that, it's enough to specify the data members to update as shown in the example.</p>
<p>The <code>orphans</code> member function literally destroys those entities that have neither components nor tags after a restore. It has exactly the same purpose described in the previous section and works the same way.</p>
<p>Finally, <code>shrink</code> helps to purge local entities that no longer have a remote conterpart. Users should invoke this member function after restoring each snapshot, unless they know exactly what they are doing.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md24"></a>
Archives</h3>
<p>Archives must publicly expose a predefined set of member functions. The API is straightforward and consists only of a group of function call operators that are invoked by the snapshot class and the loaders.</p>
<p>In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>An output archive, the one used when creating a snapshot, must expose a function call operator with the following signature to store entities:</li>
</ul>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">void</span> operator()(Entity);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Where <code>Entity</code> is the type of the entities used by the registry. Note that all the member functions of the snapshot class make also an initial call to this endpoint to save the <em>size</em> of the set they are going to store.<br />
 In addition, an archive must accept a pair of entity and either component or tag for each type to be serialized. Therefore, given a type <code>T</code>, the archive must contain a function call operator with the following signature:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">void</span> operator()(Entity, <span class="keyword">const</span> T &amp;);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>The output archive can freely decide how to serialize the data. The register is not affected at all by the decision.</p>
<ul>
<li>An input archive, the one used when restoring a snapshot, must expose a function call operator with the following signature to load entities:</li>
</ul>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">void</span> operator()(Entity &amp;);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Where <code>Entity</code> is the type of the entities used by the registry. Each time the function is invoked, the archive must read the next element from the underlying storage and copy it in the given variable. Note that all the member functions of a loader class make also an initial call to this endpoint to read the <em>size</em> of the set they are going to load.<br />
 In addition, the archive must accept a pair of entity and either component or tag for each type to be restored. Therefore, given a type <code>T</code>, the archive must contain a function call operator with the following signature:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">void</span> operator()(Entity &amp;, T &amp;);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Every time such an operator is invoked, the archive must read the next elements from the underlying storage and copy them in the given variables.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md25"></a>
One example to rule them all</h3>
<p><code>EnTT</code> comes with some examples (actually some tests) that show how to integrate a well known library for serialization as an archive. It uses <a href="https://uscilab.github.io/cereal/"><code>Cereal C++</code></a> under the hood, mainly because I wanted to learn how it works at the time I was writing the code.</p>
<p>The code is not production-ready and it isn't neither the only nor (probably) the best way to do it. However, feel free to use it at your own risk.</p>
<p>The basic idea is to store everything in a group of queues in memory, then bring everything back to the registry with different loaders.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md26"></a>
Prototype</h2>
<p>A prototype defines a type of an application in terms of its parts. They can be used to assign components to entities of a registry at once.<br />
 Roughly speaking, in most cases prototypes can be considered just as templates to use to initialize entities according to <em>concepts</em>. In fact, users can create how many prototypes they want, each one initialized differently from the others.</p>
<p>The following is an example of use of a prototype:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html">entt::DefaultRegistry</a> registry;</div><div class="line"><a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Prototype.html">entt::DefaultPrototype</a> prototype{registry};</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">prototype.set&lt;Position&gt;(100.f, 100.f);</div><div class="line">prototype.set&lt;Velocity&gt;(0.f, 0.f);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// ...</span></div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keyword">auto</span> entity = prototype();</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>To assign and remove components from a prototype, it offers two dedicated member functions named <code>set</code> and <code>unset</code>. The <code>has</code> member function can be used to know if a given prototype contains one or more components and the <code>get</code> member function can be used to retrieve the components.</p>
<p>Creating an entity from a prototype is straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>To create a new entity from scratch and assign it a prototype, this is the way to go: <div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keyword">auto</span> entity = prototype();</div></div><!-- fragment --> It is equivalent to the following invokation: <div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keyword">auto</span> entity = prototype.create();</div></div><!-- fragment --></li>
<li>In case we want to initialize an already existing entity, we can provide the <code>operator()</code> directly with the entity identifier: <div class="fragment"><div class="line">prototype(entity);</div></div><!-- fragment --> It is equivalent to the following invokation: <div class="fragment"><div class="line">prototype.assign(entity);</div></div><!-- fragment --> Note that existing components aren't overwritten in this case. Only those components that the entity doesn't own yet are copied over. All the other components remain unchanged.</li>
<li>Finally, to assign or replace all the components for an entity, thus overwriting existing ones: <div class="fragment"><div class="line">prototype.accommodate(entity);</div></div><!-- fragment --></li>
</ul>
<p>In the examples above, the prototype uses its underlying registry to create entities and components both for its purposes and when it's cloned. To use a different repository to clone a prototype, all the member functions accept also a reference to a valid registry as a first argument.</p>
<p>Prototypes are a very useful tool that can save a lot of typing sometimes. Furthermore, the codebase may be easier to maintain, since updating a prototype is much less error prone than jumping around in the codebase to update all the snippets copied and pasted around to initialize entities and components.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md27"></a>
Helpers</h2>
<p>The so called <em>helpers</em> are small classes and functions mainly designed to offer built-in support for the most basic functionalities.<br />
 The list of helpers will grow longer as time passes and new ideas come out.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md28"></a>
Dependency function</h3>
<p>A <em>dependency function</em> is a predefined listener, actually a function template to use to automatically assign components to an entity when a type has a dependency on some other types.<br />
 The following adds components <code>AType</code> and <code>AnotherType</code> whenever <code>MyType</code> is assigned to an entity:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">entt::connnect&lt;AType, AnotherType&gt;(registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#a6f6b29268ba11a8526fa3f9d3bdb58e5">construction</a>&lt;MyType&gt;());</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>A component is assigned to an entity and thus default initialized only in case the entity itself hasn't it yet. It means that already existent components won't be overriden.<br />
 A dependency can easily be broken by means of the following function template:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">entt::disconnect&lt;AType, AnotherType&gt;(registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#a6f6b29268ba11a8526fa3f9d3bdb58e5">construction</a>&lt;MyType&gt;());</div></div><!-- fragment --><h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md29"></a>
Labels</h3>
<p>There's nothing magical about the way labels can be assigned to entities while avoiding a performance hit at runtime. Nonetheless, the syntax can be annoying and that's why a more user-friendly shortcut is provided to do it.<br />
 This shortcut is the alias template <code><a class="el" href="namespaceentt.html#a8512c4b75207424bd97724a17cd1eeb0" title="Alias template to ease the assignment of labels to entities. ">entt::label</a></code>.</p>
<p>If used in combination with hashed strings, it helps to use labels where types would be required otherwise. As an example:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#a93b5717af287a2b97e0ef9695c51ed58">assign</a>&lt;<a class="code" href="namespaceentt.html#a8512c4b75207424bd97724a17cd1eeb0">entt::label</a>&lt;<span class="stringliteral">&quot;enemy&quot;</span>_hs&gt;&gt;(entity);</div></div><!-- fragment --><h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md30"></a>
Null entity</h2>
<p>In <code>EnTT</code>, there exists a sort of <em>null entity</em> made available to users that is accessible via the <code><a class="el" href="namespaceentt.html#a588326af8f6f902a6c0b57d3f9fc6c17" title="Null entity. ">entt::null</a></code> variable.<br />
 The library guarantees that the following expression always returns false:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#aaba72db4ebf99a911b58327063ec8ad9">valid</a>(<a class="code" href="namespaceentt.html#a588326af8f6f902a6c0b57d3f9fc6c17">entt::null</a>);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>In other terms, a registry will reject the null entity in all cases because it isn't considered valid. It means that the null entity cannot own components or tags for obvious reasons.<br />
 The type of the null entity is internal and should not be used for any purpose other than defining the null entity itself. However, there exist implicit conversions from the null entity to identifiers of any allowed type:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">typename</span> <a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#ad434a1920dd2c6a9a31ab482e2f29038">entt::DefaultRegistry::entity_type</a> <a class="code" href="namespaceentt.html#a588326af8f6f902a6c0b57d3f9fc6c17">null</a> = <a class="code" href="namespaceentt.html#a588326af8f6f902a6c0b57d3f9fc6c17">entt::null</a>;</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Similarly, the null entity can be compared to any other identifier:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keyword">auto</span> entity = registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#a433ac3fc8ea49347f691dd4ad1ccb58b">create</a>();</div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keywordtype">bool</span> null = (entity == <a class="code" href="namespaceentt.html#a588326af8f6f902a6c0b57d3f9fc6c17">entt::null</a>);</div></div><!-- fragment --><h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md31"></a>
View: to persist or not to persist?</h1>
<p>First of all, it is worth answering an obvious question: why views?<br />
 Roughly speaking, they are a good tool to enforce single responsibility. A system that has access to a registry can create and destroy entities, as well as assign and remove components. On the other side, a system that has access to a view can only iterate entities and their components, then read or update the data members of the latter.<br />
 It is a subtle difference that can help designing a better software sometimes.</p>
<p>There are mainly four kinds of views: standard (also known as <code>View</code>), persistent (also known as <code>PersistentView</code>), raw (also known as <code>RawView</code>) and runtime (also known as <code>RuntimeView</code>).<br />
 All of them have pros and cons to take in consideration. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Standard views:</p>
<p class="startli">Pros:</p><ul>
<li>They work out-of-the-box and don't require any dedicated data structure.</li>
<li>Creating and destroying them isn't expensive at all because they don't have any type of initialization.</li>
<li>They are the best tool for iterating entities for a single component.</li>
<li>They are the best tool for iterating entities for multiple components when one of the components is assigned to a significantly low number of entities.</li>
<li>They don't affect any other operations of the registry.</li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">Cons:</p><ul>
<li>Their performance tend to degenerate when the number of components to iterate grows up and the most of the entities have all of them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Persistent views:</p>
<p class="startli">Pros:</p><ul>
<li>Once prepared, creating and destroying them isn't expensive at all because they don't have any type of initialization.</li>
<li>They are the best tool for iterating entities for multiple components when most entities have them all.</li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">Cons:</p><ul>
<li>They have dedicated data structures and thus affect the memory usage to a minimal extent.</li>
<li>If not previously prepared, the first time they are used they go through an initialization step that could take a while.</li>
<li>They affect to a minimum the creation and destruction of entities and components. In other terms: the more persistent views there will be, the less performing will be creating and destroying entities and components.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Raw views:</p>
<p class="startli">Pros:</p><ul>
<li>They work out-of-the-box and don't require any dedicated data structure.</li>
<li>Creating and destroying them isn't expensive at all because they don't have any type of initialization.</li>
<li>They are the best tool for iterating components when it is not necessary to know which entities they belong to.</li>
<li>They don't affect any other operations of the registry.</li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">Cons:</p><ul>
<li>They can be used to iterate only one type of component at a time.</li>
<li>They don't return the entity to which a component belongs to the caller.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Runtime views:</p>
<p class="startli">Pros:</p><ul>
<li>Their lists of components are defined at runtime and not at compile-time.</li>
<li>Creating and destroying them isn't expensive at all because they don't have any type of initialization.</li>
<li>They are the best tool for things like plugin systems and mods in general.</li>
<li>They don't affect any other operations of the registry.</li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">Cons:</p><ul>
<li>Their performances are definitely lower than those of all the other views, although they are still usable and sufficient for most of the purposes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up and as a rule of thumb:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a raw view to iterate components only (no entities) for a given type.</li>
<li>Use a standard view to iterate entities and components for a single type.</li>
<li>Use a standard view to iterate entities and components for multiple types when the number of types is low. Standard views are really optimized and persistent views won't add much in this case.</li>
<li>Use a standard view to iterate entities and components for multiple types when a significantly low number of entities have one of the components.</li>
<li>Use a standard view in all those cases where a persistent view would give a boost to performance but the iteration isn't performed frequently.</li>
<li>Prepare and use a persistent view when you want to iterate only entities for multiple components.</li>
<li>Prepare and use a persistent view when you want to iterate entities for multiple components and each component is assigned to a great number of entities but the intersection between the sets of entities is small.</li>
<li>Prepare and use a persistent view in all the cases where a standard view wouldn't fit well otherwise.</li>
<li>Finally, in case you don't know at compile-time what are the components to use, choose a runtime view and set them during execution.</li>
</ul>
<p>To easily iterate entities and components, all the views offer the common <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> member functions that allow users to use a view in a typical range-for loop. Almost all the views offer also a <em>more functional</em> <code>each</code> member function that accepts a callback for convenience.<br />
 Continue reading for more details or refer to the inline documentation.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md32"></a>
Standard View</h2>
<p>A standard view behaves differently if it's constructed for a single component or if it has been requested to iterate multiple components. Even the API is different in the two cases.<br />
 All that they share is the way they are created by means of a registry:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="comment">// single component standard view</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> single = registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#aed83d4c8f80ae647ee73f2a8440fa09d">view</a>&lt;Position&gt;();</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// multi component standard view</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> multi = registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#aed83d4c8f80ae647ee73f2a8440fa09d">view</a>&lt;Position, Velocity&gt;();</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>For all that remains, it's worth discussing them separately.<br />
</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md33"></a>
Single component standard view</h3>
<p>Single component standard views are specialized in order to give a boost in terms of performance in all the situation. This kind of views can access the underlying data structures directly and avoid superfluous checks.<br />
 They offer a bunch of functionalities to get the number of entities they are going to return and a raw access to the entity list as well as to the component list. It's also possible to ask a view if it contains a given entity.<br />
 Refer to the inline documentation for all the details.</p>
<p>There is no need to store views around for they are extremely cheap to construct, even though they can be copied without problems and reused freely. In fact, they return newly created and correctly initialized iterators whenever <code>begin</code> or <code>end</code> are invoked.<br />
 To iterate a single component standard view, either use it in a range-for loop:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> view = registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#aed83d4c8f80ae647ee73f2a8440fa09d">view</a>&lt;Renderable&gt;();</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="keywordflow">for</span>(<span class="keyword">auto</span> entity: view) {</div><div class="line">    Renderable &amp;renderable = view.get(entity);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// ...</span></div><div class="line">}</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Or rely on the <code>each</code> member function to iterate entities and get all their components at once:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#aed83d4c8f80ae647ee73f2a8440fa09d">view</a>&lt;Renderable&gt;().each([](<span class="keyword">auto</span> entity, <span class="keyword">auto</span> &amp;renderable) {</div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// ...</span></div><div class="line">});</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>The <code>each</code> member function is highly optimized. Unless users want to iterate only entities, using <code>each</code> should be the preferred approach.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: prefer the <code>get</code> member function of a view instead of the <code>get</code> member function template of a registry during iterations, if possible. However, keep in mind that it works only with the components of the view itself.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md34"></a>
Multi component standard view</h3>
<p>Multi component standard views iterate entities that have at least all the given components in their bags. During construction, these views look at the number of entities available for each component and pick up a reference to the smallest set of candidates in order to speed up iterations.<br />
 They offer fewer functionalities than their companion views for single component. In particular, a multi component standard view exposes utility functions to get the estimated number of entities it is going to return and to know whether it's empty or not. It's also possible to ask a view if it contains a given entity.<br />
 Refer to the inline documentation for all the details.</p>
<p>There is no need to store views around for they are extremely cheap to construct, even though they can be copied without problems and reused freely. In fact, they return newly created and correctly initialized iterators whenever <code>begin</code> or <code>end</code> are invoked.<br />
 To iterate a multi component standard view, either use it in a range-for loop:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> view = registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#aed83d4c8f80ae647ee73f2a8440fa09d">view</a>&lt;Position, Velocity&gt;();</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="keywordflow">for</span>(<span class="keyword">auto</span> entity: view) {</div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// a component at a time ...</span></div><div class="line">    Position &amp;position = view.get&lt;Position&gt;(entity);</div><div class="line">    Velocity &amp;velocity = view.get&lt;Velocity&gt;(entity);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// ... or multiple components at once</span></div><div class="line">    std::tuple&lt;Position &amp;, Velocity &amp;&gt; tup = view.get&lt;Position, Velocity&gt;(entity);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// ...</span></div><div class="line">}</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Or rely on the <code>each</code> member function to iterate entities and get all their components at once:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#aed83d4c8f80ae647ee73f2a8440fa09d">view</a>&lt;Position, Velocity&gt;().each([](<span class="keyword">auto</span> entity, <span class="keyword">auto</span> &amp;position, <span class="keyword">auto</span> &amp;velocity) {</div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// ...</span></div><div class="line">});</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>The <code>each</code> member function is highly optimized. Unless users want to iterate only entities or get only some of the components, using <code>each</code> should be the preferred approach.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: prefer the <code>get</code> member function of a view instead of the <code>get</code> member function template of a registry during iterations, if possible. However, keep in mind that it works only with the components of the view itself.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md35"></a>
Persistent View</h2>
<p>A persistent view returns all the entities and only the entities that have at least the given components. Moreover, it's guaranteed that the entity list is tightly packed in memory for fast iterations.<br />
 In general, persistent views don't stay true to the order of any set of components unless users explicitly sort them.</p>
<p>Persistent views can be used only to iterate multiple components. To create this kind of views, the tag <code>persistent_t</code> must also be used in order to disambiguate overloads of the <code>view</code> member function:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> view = registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#aed83d4c8f80ae647ee73f2a8440fa09d">view</a>&lt;Position, Velocity&gt;(<a class="code" href="structentt_1_1persistent__t.html">entt::persistent_t</a>{});</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>There is no need to store views around for they are extremely cheap to construct, even though they can be copied without problems and reused freely. In fact, they return newly created and correctly initialized iterators whenever <code>begin</code> or <code>end</code> are invoked.<br />
 That being said, persistent views perform an initialization step the very first time they are constructed and this could be quite costly. To avoid it, consider asking to the registry to <em>prepare</em> them when no entities have been created yet:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#ac05c9ccc5fe57df386d8104578fc9675">prepare</a>&lt;Position, Velocity&gt;();</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>If the registry is empty, preparation is extremely fast. Moreover the <code>prepare</code> member function template is idempotent. Feel free to invoke it even more than once: if the view has been already prepared before, the function returns immediately and does nothing.</p>
<p>A persistent view offers a bunch of functionalities to get the number of entities it's going to return, a raw access to the entity list and the possibility to sort the underlying data structures according to the order of one of the components for which it has been constructed. It's also possible to ask a view if it contains a given entity.<br />
 Refer to the inline documentation for all the details.</p>
<p>To iterate a persistent view, either use it in a range-for loop:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> view = registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#aed83d4c8f80ae647ee73f2a8440fa09d">view</a>&lt;Position, Velocity&gt;(<a class="code" href="structentt_1_1persistent__t.html">entt::persistent_t</a>{});</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="keywordflow">for</span>(<span class="keyword">auto</span> entity: view) {</div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// a component at a time ...</span></div><div class="line">    Position &amp;position = view.get&lt;Position&gt;(entity);</div><div class="line">    Velocity &amp;velocity = view.get&lt;Velocity&gt;(entity);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// ... or multiple components at once</span></div><div class="line">    std::tuple&lt;Position &amp;, Velocity &amp;&gt; tup = view.get&lt;Position, Velocity&gt;(entity);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// ...</span></div><div class="line">}</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Or rely on the <code>each</code> member function to iterate entities and get all their components at once:</p>

The best approach depends mainly on whether all the components have to be accessed or not.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: prefer the <code>get</code> member function of a view instead of the <code>get</code> member function template of a registry during iterations, if possible. However, keep in mind that it works only with the components of the view itself.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md36"></a>
Raw View</h2>
<p>Raw views return all the components of a given type. This kind of views can access components directly and avoid extra indirections like when components are accessed via an entity identifier.<br />
 They offer a bunch of functionalities to get the number of instances they are going to return and a raw access to the entity list as well as to the component list.<br />
 Refer to the inline documentation for all the details.</p>
<p>Raw views can be used only to iterate components for a single type. To create this kind of views, the tag <code>raw_t</code> must also be used in order to disambiguate overloads of the <code>view</code> member function:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> view = registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#aed83d4c8f80ae647ee73f2a8440fa09d">view</a>&lt;Renderable&gt;(<a class="code" href="structentt_1_1raw__t.html">entt::raw_t</a>{});</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>There is no need to store views around for they are extremely cheap to construct, even though they can be copied without problems and reused freely. In fact, they return newly created and correctly initialized iterators whenever <code>begin</code> or <code>end</code> are invoked.<br />
 To iterate a raw view, use it in a range-for loop:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> view = registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#aed83d4c8f80ae647ee73f2a8440fa09d">view</a>&lt;Renderable&gt;(<a class="code" href="structentt_1_1raw__t.html">entt::raw_t</a>{});</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="keywordflow">for</span>(<span class="keyword">auto</span> &amp;&amp;component: raw) {</div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// ...</span></div><div class="line">}</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Or rely on the <code>each</code> member function:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#aed83d4c8f80ae647ee73f2a8440fa09d">view</a>&lt;Renderable&gt;(<a class="code" href="structentt_1_1raw__t.html">entt::raw_t</a>{}).each([](<span class="keyword">auto</span> &amp;renderable) {</div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// ...</span></div><div class="line">});</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Performance are exactly the same in both cases.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: raw views don't have a <code>get</code> member function for obvious reasons.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md37"></a>
Runtime View</h2>
<p>Runtime views iterate entities that have at least all the given components in their bags. During construction, these views look at the number of entities available for each component and pick up a reference to the smallest set of candidates in order to speed up iterations.<br />
 They offer more or less the same functionalities of a multi component standard view. However, they don't expose a <code>get</code> member function and users should refer to the registry that generated the view to access components. In particular, a runtime view exposes utility functions to get the estimated number of entities it is going to return and to know whether it's empty or not. It's also possible to ask a view if it contains a given entity.<br />
 Refer to the inline documentation for all the details.</p>
<p>Runtime view are extremely cheap to construct and should not be stored around in any case. They should be used immediately after creation and then they should be thrown away. The reasons for this go far beyond the scope of this document.<br />
 To iterate a runtime view, either use it in a range-for loop:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">using</span> component_type = <span class="keyword">typename</span> decltype(registry)::component_type;</div><div class="line">component_type types[] = { registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#a682552d500d7768b5d9d4e5f547cdfaf">type</a>&lt;Position&gt;(), registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#a682552d500d7768b5d9d4e5f547cdfaf">type</a>&lt;Velocity&gt;() };</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> view = registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#aed83d4c8f80ae647ee73f2a8440fa09d">view</a>(std::cbegin(types), std::cend(types));</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="keywordflow">for</span>(<span class="keyword">auto</span> entity: view) {</div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// a component at a time ...</span></div><div class="line">    Position &amp;position = registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#a2079fb67093feb86b75e9dede6bb6c4d">get</a>&lt;Position&gt;(entity);</div><div class="line">    Velocity &amp;velocity = registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#a2079fb67093feb86b75e9dede6bb6c4d">get</a>&lt;Velocity&gt;(entity);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// ... or multiple components at once</span></div><div class="line">    std::tuple&lt;Position &amp;, Velocity &amp;&gt; tup = view.get&lt;Position, Velocity&gt;(entity);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// ...</span></div><div class="line">}</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Or rely on the <code>each</code> member function to iterate entities:</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: runtime views are meant for all those cases where users don't know at compile-time what components to use to iterate entities. This is particularly well suited to plugin systems and mods in general. Where possible, don't use runtime views, as their performance are slightly inferior to those of the other views.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md38"></a>
Give me everything</h2>
<p>Views are narrow windows on the entire list of entities. They work by filtering entities according to their components.<br />
 In some cases there may be the need to iterate all the entities still in use regardless of their components. The registry offers a specific member function to do that:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#a1d7547f6d8503265480d235fe48dfb1d">each</a>([](<span class="keyword">auto</span> entity) {</div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// ...</span></div><div class="line">});</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>It returns to the caller all the entities that are still in use by means of the given function.<br />
 As a rule of thumb, consider using a view if the goal is to iterate entities that have a determinate set of components. A view is usually much faster than combining this function with a bunch of custom tests.<br />
 In all the other cases, this is the way to go.</p>
<p>There exists also another member function to use to retrieve orphans. An orphan is an entity that is still in use and has neither assigned components nor tags.<br />
 The signature of the function is the same of <code>each</code>:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#ada2900e50f66573c14821baac03bbd68">orphans</a>([](<span class="keyword">auto</span> entity) {</div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// ...</span></div><div class="line">});</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>To test the <em>orphanity</em> of a single entity, use the member function <code>orphan</code> instead. It accepts a valid entity identifer as an argument and returns true in case the entity is an orphan, false otherwise.</p>
<p>In general, all these functions can result in poor performance.<br />
 <code>each</code> is fairly slow because of some checks it performs on each and every entity. For similar reasons, <code>orphans</code> can be even slower. Both functions should not be used frequently to avoid the risk of a performance hit.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md39"></a>
Iterations: what is allowed and what is not</h1>
<p>Most of the <em>ECS</em> available out there have some annoying limitations (at least from my point of view): entities and components cannot be created nor destroyed during iterations.<br />
 <code>EnTT</code> partially solves the problem with a few limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating entities and components is allowed during iterations.</li>
<li>Deleting an entity or removing its components is allowed during iterations if it's the one currently returned by the view. For all the other entities, destroying them or removing their components isn't allowed and it can result in undefined behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>Iterators are invalidated and the behavior is undefined if an entity is modified or destroyed and it's not the one currently returned by the view nor a newly created one.<br />
 To work around it, possible approaches are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Store aside the entities and the components to be removed and perform the operations at the end of the iteration.</li>
<li>Mark entities and components with a proper tag component that indicates they must be purged, then perform a second iteration to clean them up one by one.</li>
</ul>
<p>A notable side effect of this feature is that the number of required allocations is further reduced in most of the cases.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md40"></a>
Multithreading</h1>
<p>In general, the entire registry isn't thread safe as it is. Thread safety isn't something that users should want out of the box for several reasons. Just to mention one of them: performance.<br />
 Views and consequently the approach adopted by <code>EnTT</code> are the great exception to the rule. It's true that views and thus their iterators aren't thread safe by themselves. Because of this users shouldn't try to iterate a set of components and modify the same set concurrently. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>As long as a thread iterates the entities that have the component <code>X</code> or assign and removes that component from a set of entities, another thread can safely do the same with components <code>Y</code> and <code>Z</code> and everything will work like a charm. As a trivial example, users can freely execute the rendering system and iterate the renderable entities while updating a physic component concurrently on a separate thread.</li>
<li>Similarly, a single set of components can be iterated by multiple threads as long as the components are neither assigned nor removed in the meantime. In other words, a hypothetical movement system can start multiple threads, each of which will access the components that carry information about velocity and position for its entities.</li>
</ul>
<p>This kind of entity-component systems can be used in single threaded applications as well as along with async stuff or multiple threads. Moreover, typical thread based models for <em>ECS</em> don't require a fully thread safe registry to work. Actually, users can reach the goal with the registry as it is while working with most of the common models.</p>
<p>Because of the few reasons mentioned above and many others not mentioned, users are completely responsible for synchronization whether required. On the other hand, they could get away with it without having to resort to particular expedients. </p>
